Phasmophobia Settings Selector GUI

A graphical user interface (GUI) built on Python, the Phasmophobia Settings Selector GUI lets users customise their settings in the well-known horror game Phasmophobia. In Kinetic Games' multiplayer psychological horror game Phasmophobia, players investigate haunted sites as ghost hunters.

With this graphical user interface tool, players can create custom mode and difficulty parameters for their Phasmophobia sessions at random. Players can quickly alter several game elements, including contract, ghost, and player settings. To further improve the user experience, the GUI has a console for showing messages and interactions.

Important characteristics:
Random Custom Mode Selection: To add a surprise and challenging element to their gaming sessions, players can choose the "Random Custom Mode" option.
Random Difficulty Selection: By randomly allowing players to choose their Phasmophobia sessions' difficulty levels, the "Random Difficulty" button spices up the gameplay and adds excitement.
The GUI has a "theme toggle" function that lets users alternate between light and dark modes according to their preferences.

Learning Aid: The GUI can be used as a teaching aid to help players comprehend the effects of various game parameters on gameplay. New players can try out different combinations of settings to find their favourite way to play.
Community Engagement: The project's open-source design fosters cooperation and contributions from the Phasmophobia community, enabling the GUI's functionality to be expanded and improved over time.
