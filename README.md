Phasmophobia Settings Selector GUI

A graphical user interface (GUI) built on Python, the Phasmophobia Settings Selector GUI lets users customise their settings in the well-known horror game Phasmophobia. In Kinetic Games' multiplayer psychological horror game Phasmophobia, players investigate haunted sites as ghost hunters.

With this graphical user interface tool, players can create custom mode and difficulty parameters for their Phasmophobia sessions at random. Players can quickly alter several game elements, including contract, ghost, and player settings. To further improve the user experience, the GUI has a console for showing messages and interactions.

Important characteristics:
Random Custom Mode Selection: To add a surprise and challenging element to their gaming sessions, players can choose the "Random Custom Mode" option.
Random Difficulty Selection: By randomly allowing players to choose their Phasmophobia sessions' difficulty levels, the "Random Difficulty" button spices up the gameplay and adds excitement.
The GUI has a "theme toggle" function that lets users alternate between light and dark modes according to their preferences.

Console Output: During the settings selection process, the user is given feedback and direction through a console window that shows messages and outputs related to their interactions.

Simple to Use Interface: Both novice and expert players may easily navigate and adjust their game settings thanks to the user-friendly interface.

Applications and Advantages:
Accessibility: Phasmophobia's vast environments may be challenging for new players to explore. This GUI application streamlines the procedure so novices can more easily modify settings to suit their tastes.

Variety and Replayability: The GUI increases the game's replayability by giving players different and unpredictable experiences with every playtime by providing randomisation choices for the settings.

Learning Aid: The GUI can be used as a teaching aid to help players comprehend the effects of various game parameters on gameplay. New players can try out different combinations of settings to find their favourite way to play.
Community Engagement: The project's open-source design fosters cooperation and contributions from the Phasmophobia community, enabling the GUI's functionality to be expanded and improved over time.

In conclusion, Phasmophobia players looking to improve their overall gaming experience and expedite the process of personalising game settings will find great value in the Phasmophobia Settings Selector GUI. This GUI intends to provide players more flexibility and enjoyment in their ghost-hunting experiences, whether introducing a random aspect to gameplay or streamlining the settings adjustment process.
